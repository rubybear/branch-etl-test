# Branch take home test

## Tasks:

1. Using the json response from the endpoint. Model, and design the database table/tables.
	-	You can use [dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/d) to generate the ERD
	-	_Deliverable_: Export of ERD ![](/home/ruby/PycharmProjects/workspace/branch_etl/resources/images/branch_erd.png)

2. Build an end to end process in Python3, that generates a csv file for each of the tables you have designed
	-  The JSON results must be flatten
	-  The column names must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), or underscores (_)
	-  _Deliverable_: The python code, that can generate the csv files. 

3. Now imagine this is a production ETL process. How would you design it? What tests would you put in place?
  - _Deliverable_: Any diagrams/text files that can show us your design.
